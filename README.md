# Simple Todo List

Welcome to the Simple Todo List project! This is a straightforward web application that allows users to create and manage a list of tasks. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed by clicking on them, and delete tasks they no longer need.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you don't need to install any dependencies or set up a database. It's a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application that runs directly in your web browser.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/YourmixJNR/To-do_List_HTML-CSS-JS.git

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Start adding tasks to your todo list!

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to your todo list.

- **Mark as Completed:** Simply click on a task to mark it as completed. It will have a line-through to indicate completion.

- **Delete Tasks:** If you want to remove a task, click the "Delete" button next to it.

## What I Learned

In the process of building this project, I learned about event delegation. Event delegation is a technique that allows for efficient event handling, especially when dealing with a large number of elements. It helped me improve the performance and maintainability of my code by attaching a single event listener to a common ancestor element and handling events based on the target element.
